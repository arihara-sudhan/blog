⌾ If we go to the field very-slow, there will be an AI-powered farmer with a plough...  
⌾ If we go to the hotel with hunger, there will be an AI-powered chef with ginger...  
⌾ If we go to the hospital ill, there will be an AI-powered doctor with a pill...  
⌾ If we go to the zoo with fear, there will be AI-powered animals with cheer...  
⌾ If we go to the office to work, there will be AI-powered employees that 𝗹𝘂𝗿𝗸...  

There is a famous interview question: "𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘀𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻?" When the candidate answers, "𝗜 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 N 𝗹𝗮𝗸𝗵 𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗻𝗻𝘂𝗺" as one of my brothers demanded funnily, the interviewer will lock you with the response: "𝗪𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗻 𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗲𝗲 𝘄𝗵𝗼 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗻𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗵 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 0 𝗟𝗣𝗔; 𝘄𝗵𝘆 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘄𝗲 𝗴𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗺𝘂𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗿𝘆?" [Note: That employee ∈ Imaginary World]

So, don't answer a number as your salary expectation! Just say, "𝗚𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗺𝗲 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗴𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗺𝘆 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀." 😑 (With a smile)

The thing is, the locking question hereafter will be: "𝗪𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗔𝗜-𝗽𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗲𝗲𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗼 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗻𝗼 𝗵𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗵 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗶𝘁𝘆; 𝘄𝗵𝘆 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘄𝗲 𝗵𝗶𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂?"
[Some Interviewers to Me: Thank you for the idea of asking this question 😉]

How will you answer this question?
In simple words, it's not about answering the interview question. The question is about your value!

I face people who ask me, "𝗯𝗿𝗼, 𝗶 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝗻𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗷𝘀; 𝗶 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗷𝘀; 𝗶 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝗷𝗮𝘃𝗮."  
Well! Why do you guys use small letters first of all? 🤧 Secondly, isn't there anything else beyond these cherry-picked things? Aren't you destined to learn more and more, on and on and on? Or don't you have time? Or don't you have interest? Or don't you have good guidance?

Why are you limiting yourself to these things?  
Not only in nature! The simple rule that applies in the technological world is also: "𝗦𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗶𝘃𝗮𝗹 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝘁𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁." Never be constant! Learn and evolve as time changes! If you are not fit enough, you will not be fitted in. Equip yourself with various knowledge! It shouldn't end with you! Educate your neighbor... Yes! The bench guys!

𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗼𝗿𝗲! 𝗘𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗲! 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗼𝗶𝘁! 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲! 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗵!  
Hey... English? Yes, English! Learn it well 🤧! Be fluent in it! Learn new words and try to make your speech teemed with them!

The thing is, don't just be a fan/user of AI!
Be an AI practitioner too! Nowadays, it is quite necessary to understand how AI works! Understand & practice it! Not only AI! Learn much! But be a master of a few, not just one! Your skill set should increase in size with time! You should evolve with time... By time, I mean the advent of new things like AI. Be prepared! Not only for interviews! But for the future! 
Keep evolving!
