# Building a Simple Blog with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

In this post, I'll walk you through the process of creating a simple yet functional blog using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no complex frameworks required!

## Why Keep It Simple?

Sometimes the best solution is the simplest one. By using vanilla web technologies, we achieve:

- **Fast Loading**: No heavy frameworks to download
- **Easy Maintenance**: Simple code that's easy to understand and modify
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works everywhere without dependencies
- **Full Control**: Complete control over every aspect of the design

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Markdown Support
Using the `marked.js` library, we can write posts in Markdown format, making content creation intuitive and efficient.

```javascript
// Render markdown content
const htmlContent = marked.parse(post.content);
document.getElementById('post-content').innerHTML = htmlContent;
```

### 2. Unique URLs
Each post gets its own URL using hash routing, making it easy to share specific posts.

```javascript
// Navigate to specific post
window.location.hash = `post/${postId}`;
```

### 3. Local Storage Database
All data (posts, comments, likes) is stored in the browser's local storage, creating a persistent experience without requiring a backend server.

### 4. Responsive Design
The blog uses CSS with `vw` units for truly responsive design that adapts to any screen size.

## The Architecture

The blog follows a simple but effective structure:

- **HTML**: Semantic structure and content
- **CSS**: Responsive styling with modern design principles
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic functionality and data management
- **JSON**: Local storage for persistence

## Adding New Posts

To add a new post, simply create a new `.md` file in the `posts/` directory with frontmatter metadata:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2024-01-21"
author: "Your Name"
image: "optional-image-url"
---

# Your Post Content

Write your content here in Markdown format...
```

## Conclusion

This approach demonstrates that you don't always need complex frameworks to build functional web applications. Sometimes, a simple solution built with core web technologies can be the most effective choice.

The blog is now ready to use, with all the essential features a modern blog needs: unique URLs, commenting, liking, and a responsive design that works beautifully on all devices.
