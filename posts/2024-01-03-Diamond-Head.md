DiamondHead Killifish
</video>
As the video depicts, it's truly nostalgic for me!
I witnessed these fish after nearly 8 years, I guess... In my native place (Tirunelveli: Famous for Halwa), there's a lush village called Kallidaikurichi (Famous for Appalam/Pappadam).

The river Thamirabarani flows there, known locally as Karambai Aaru. It's part of my village culture to bathe in that river after celebrating the annual temple function called "Koyil Kodai".

In my childhood, while swimming in the Karambai Aaru with my father, I encountered these fish. Their specialty is the diamond-like structure on their heads. These fish always swim near the surface!

However, after that, I couldn't find them again in my life. I came to the conclusion that I must have been dreaming when I saw such diamond-headed fish. It seemed like a figment of my imagination as I couldn't spot such fish for more years in the same Karambai Aaru. I thought I had imagined them in my childhood. 
Even Google couldn't show me such fish; instead, it showed some other kind!

But now, just a few days ago, when I went to Tirunelveli, I accidentally stepped into the Thamirabarani river, and oh my God! Tears came to my eyes! I found my fishes with glittering diamond heads!

I came to know that they are a type of Killi Fish!
This time, thanks to the Thamirabarani River. ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º
