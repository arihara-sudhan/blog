### KEY and Pretraining in TRANSFORMERS... 🗝

QUERY: I am the vector representing the word of interest.
KEY: I am the vector holding the information on how much attention should be paid to each word with respect to QUERY.
VALUE: I am the vector of the word of interest that gets weighted after knowing the contextual information of QUERY.

> Here, how does KEY know how much attention should be paid to each word?

> If we have a sentence like 'The tiger comes from the south, and it is the direction of divinity', what does the word 'it' in the sentence refer to? 

> Apparently, it refers to the direction 'south' because the tiger is not a direction! It's an animal belonging to the Panther Family (panthera tigris). 🐯

> When QUERY is 'Tiger' and KEY is the word 'it', the multiplication of QUERY and KEY will have a low value. However, when QUERY is 'South' and KEY is the word 'it', the multiplication of QUERY and KEY will have a high value. 🤠

> But how? How does KEY instruct the learning correctly? How did KEY acquire this information, something akin to human-level understanding? The answer is during Pretraining! 😲

Pretraining is when the transformer learns how to determine the meaning of a word based on the CONTEXT! On a large chunk of data (corpus), pretraining is conducted to understand how words are aligned, how they are associated with each other, the underlying patterns, and so on. 😍

Yes, KEY information is learned during pretraining. 🤩
